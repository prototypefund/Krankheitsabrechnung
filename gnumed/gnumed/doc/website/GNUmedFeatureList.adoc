== FAQ

*Q:* What does "do for me today" mean ?

*A:* It means you can link:InstallerGuideHome[download]
GNUmed and rightfully expect to be enabled to do any of the
above. It may not work the way you expect it to but there
should be a way to accomplish those tasks and it should
*work*. It is your right to (and our hope that you do) email
the developer list on anything that does *not* work as
advertised.

*Q:* But I can't do the advertised tasks in the browser interface/the ... interface !

*A:* That is correct. The above refers only to the wxPython
reference client GUI. Other frontends may be lagging behind
or (in theory, at least) could be further ahead.
