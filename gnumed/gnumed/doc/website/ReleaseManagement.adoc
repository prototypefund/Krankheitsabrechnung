.Release Management

This page documents the suggested procedure to smoothly release a new
version.

:toc:

== Before Release

=== Development _(VCS HEAD)_

* fix feature set in link:RoadMap[Roadmap]
* complete features in https://github.com/ncqgm/gnumed[source code repository]
* fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/gnumed/+bugs[bugs] reported in the bug
tracker
* complete database schema changes
* update link:GnumedManual[User Manual]
* update https://www.gnumed.de/bin/view/Gnumed/PublishManual[manual
publisher topic]
* initial round of link:ReleaseTesting[testing] for release fitness

== Preparing _X.Y.rcN_ release candidates

=== branch `master`

* `grep` the tree for instances of the old database name and replace
with the new one where appropriate
* `pycommon/gmPG2.py`:
** add hash of new database
** teach it which database version to expect for the new client branch
* create `Inbox` message with Release Notes via SQL script
* `make-release_tarball.sh`: include SQL upgrade scripts
* download and merge any new translations from Launchpad
* adjust `client/gm-from-vcs.conf`
* create branch: `git branch rc-X-Y`

=== branch `rc-X-Y`

_(wash/rinse/repeat as needed)_

* `git checkout rc-X-Y`
* `git merge master`
* update `Inbox` message with Release Notes
* `bootstrap-latest.sh/.bat`: include latest database release
* `bootstrap-latest.conf`: include latest `upgrade-vN_vN+1.conf`
* `upgrade-vN_vN+1.conf`: expect new database version instead of _devel_
* `client/doc/make-*.sh` scripts: refer to the proper databases
* `make-release_tarball.sh`: set proper database version and client
version _X.Y.rcN_
* `wxpython/gnumed.py`: set client version _X.Y.rcN_
* link:ReleaseTesting[test] basic functionality (startup )
* tag tree: `git tag rel-X-Y-rcN`
* https://www.gnumed.de/bin/view/Gnumed/PublishManual[re-publish manual]
* create tarball
* publish Release Candidate in our
https://www.gnumed.de/downloads/[download area]
* adjust `gm-versions.txt`
* upgrade public database

* incorporate http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnumed-devel/[feedback],
fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/gnumed/+bugs[bugs]

== Preparing the _X.Y.0_ release

* `git checkout master`

* `gm-net_upgrade_server.sh`: refer to the latest database version
* `bootstrap-latest.sh/.bat`: include latest database release
* `bootstrap-latest.conf`: include latest `upgrade-vN_vN+1.conf`
* updates release notes SQL script and set version numbers from `.rcN`
zu `X.Y.0`
* in `CHANGELOG` set version numbers from `.rcN` zu `X.Y.0`
* create empty `fixup_db-vNN.conf` (so that `gm-fixup_server` doesn't
fail even if useless)
* `git commit -v`

Create `rel-X-Y`:

* `git branch tmp`
* `git checkout tmp`
* `git merge rc-X-Y`
* `git merge --abort` and fix any problems in `master` and/or `rc-X-Y`
* retry `git merge rc-X-Y` until it works
* `git checkout master`
* `git branch -d tmp`
* `git tag -s rel-X-Y`
* `git branch rel-X-Y-maint rel-X-Y` (create a branch from that tag)
* `git checkout rel-X-Y-maint`
* `git merge rc-X-Y`
* `git branch -d rc-X-Y`
* activate "tarball release options" in `gm-from-vcs.sh`

* update list of link:WhatCanIActuallyDOWithGNUmedToday[current
features]
* update link:InstallerGuideHome[installation instructions]

== Releasing an _X.Y.N_ version

* `git checkout rel-X-Y-maint`

_(wash/rinse/repeat as needed)_

* update `Inbox` message with release notes
* run database release tests:
** database bootstrap (`bootstrap-latest.sh`)
** database upgrade (`upgrade-db.sh`)
** database fixup (`fixup-db.sh`)

* `gnumed/client/gnumed.py`: set client version _X.Y.N_
* run client release tests:
** client startup (`gm-from-vcs.sh`)
*** from the console
*** without a console (invoke `gm-from-vcs.sh` from, say, dolphin)
*** patient activation
*** activate each tab once
*** http://de.fakenamegenerator.com/gen-female-gr-gr.php[new patient] creation
*** again, activate each tab once

* `dists/Linux/make-release_tarball.sh`: set proper client version _X.Y.N_
* `dists/Linux/make-release_tarball.sh`: include SQL fixup scripts (also in branch `master`)
* test building tarball
** run `dists/Linux/make-release_tarball.sh`

* `git add gnumed.py`
* `git add make-release_tarball.sh`
* `git commit -v` (suggested message "Prepare X.Y.N release")
* `git tag -s rel-X-Y-N` (suggested message "Stamp X.Y.N release")
* https://www.gnumed.de/bin/view/Gnumed/PublishManual[re-publish manual]

* build tarball
** run `dists/Linux/make-release_tarball.sh`

* upload to https://www.gnumed.de/downloads/["Savannah"]
* adjust https://www.gnumed.de/downloads/gnumed-versions.txt[`gnumed-versions.txt` ]
* update link:ReleaseStatus[release status] page

* build packages for version X.Y.N
** Debian package
** Windows installer
** Mandriva RPM
** Suse RPM
** Gentoo ebuild
** MacOSX DMG image
** ... ?
* incorporate http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnumed-devel/[feedback],
fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/gnumed/+bugs[bugs]

== After Release

* take a break
* fix bugs in _rel-X-Y-Z-maint_
* take another break
* think about next Release


== The GNUmed Versioning Scheme

Versions are defined by the corresponding tag in the CVS tree. The
version string consists of 3 parts:

* major version, currently 0
* minor version, currently 5
* patch level or release candidate

Features will only be introduced between minor-version changes. Patch
level releases will _never_ have new features, they will only ever
receive bug fixes. Bug fixes are applied to CVS HEAD and to the latest
release only so it is advised to stay up to date with released versions.
Patch level releases will also _never_ require a database change.

The tagging strategy is this (assuming 0.4):

The code gets ready for a release. Let's assume the release is to be
`v0.4.0`. The CVS trunk (HEAD) is tagged as _rel-0-4_. This tag will
become the root of a branch on which the actual 0.4.0 release will
happen while HEAD can continue to evolve. A branch _rel-0-4-maint_ is
created and rooted at tag _rel-0-4_. This branch will only ever receive
bug fixes. In that branch the tag _rel-0-4-rc1_ is set which will then
be released as `v0.4.rc1`.

Bugs get fixed and eventually the branch is tagged as _rel-0-4-0_ which
gets released as `v0.4.0`. More bugs get fixed and eventually the branch
is tagged as _rel-0-4-1_ which then gets released as `v0.4.1`.

Eventually, CVS HEAD is tagged as _rel-0-5_, branched off into
_rel-0-5-maint_ and the cycle starts over.

The database schema is versioned independent of the client. At startup
the client checks whether it was released to work with the database it
connects to. For any necessary database upgrades we provide tested,
integrity-checking conversion scripts.
