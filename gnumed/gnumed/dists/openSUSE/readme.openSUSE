Be aware that the default permissions of PostgreSQL (the database backend for GNUmed) on openSUSE are potentially set wide open. If you start using GNUmed server for any actual client information, you could potentially be exposing all client data UNLESS you first properly restrict PG permissions. The PG permissions are defined in /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf. Please see http://publicdb.gnumed.de/bin/view/Gnumed/ConfigurePostgreSQL for more information on how to configure PG for security.
