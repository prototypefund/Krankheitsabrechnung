Hello all,

I am glad to be able to announce the immediate availability
of the GNUmed xx.x.x Feature Release.


Downloads available from:

	https://www.gnumed.de/downloads/client/xx.x/
	https://www.gnumed.de/downloads/server/vxx/


Client installation:

 Easily installable packages for your platform of choice
 will be available shortly.

 Meanwhile you can run the client from a downloaded tarball
 or use the net based client installer:

	https://www.gnumed.de/downloads/client/gm-install_client_locally.sh

 which you need to download, make executable, and run.

 More information available here:

	https://www.gnumed.de/documentation/GNUmedInstallation.html

Database upgrade (existing DB):

 Note that this release, as usual, DOES require a database
 upgrade (from vxx to vxx) if you wish to retain patient data
 contained within an existing database.

 Your platform may provide new server packages in which
 case you can likely use the systemwide upgrade script:

	$> gm-upgrade_server xx xx

 If you are upgrading from a server tarball you can use the
 script provided in the download:

	$> cd .../server/bootstrap/
	$> ./upgrade-db.sh xx xx

 Alternatively, you may consider useingthe network upgrader:

	https://www.gnumed.de/downloads/server/net_upgrade-gnumed_server.sh

 (which you would need to download, make executable and run)

 More information on upgrading is found here:

	https://www.gnumed.de/documentation/GNUmedDatabaseUpgrade.html


Database installation (new DB):

 If you wish to install a fresh database (either if you do
 not yet have a database or if you want to ignore and
 OVERWRITE any existing GNUmed databases) you have several
 options all of which WILL DELETE existing databases !

 Your platform may provide new server packages in which
 case you can likely use the systemwide install script:

	$> gm-bootstrap_server

 If you are installing from a server tarball you can use the
 script provided in the download:

	$> cd .../server/bootstrap/
	$> ./boostrap-latest.sh

 or, again, the network based installer:

	https://www.gnumed.de/downloads/server/net_install-gnumed_server.sh

 More information on installation is found here:

	https://www.gnumed.de/documentation/GNUmedDatabaseInstallation.html


Changelog:

	xx replace with CHANGELOG xx




Please download, install, and report problems !

Thanks,
Karsten
