( Wing Yam Tsoi, Gunal Kanna, Ming Chan ) , 

Brief steps:
1. DOWNLOAD -  download and install dependencies - postgres (with jdbc.jar java driver package) , gnumed, drugref, jdk1.4+ , ant, jakarta tomcat.

2. DOWNLOAD -  the app package , tar -zxvf to gunzip and untar

3. CONFIGURE- check configuration in ./war-context.xml and ./META-INF/context.xmll have the correct database names and user names
for gnumed and drug-ref. Ensure the users' have access permissions. The first time the app is run, v_drugref1 will
be created as a view in drugref, and if the user is not the owner, than permissions to this view need to be set manually
using psql (at the moment).  

In the script set_perms_drugref.sh, match the users listed in the script with the users in context.xml then run it using sh.


4. CONFIGURE , COMPILE - run *copy_lib.sh* , after editing it and ensuring it's paths are correct,
 then run *ant* in ./WEB-INF/src to compile and to create a gnumes-test-war.war in ./dist .

*Also ensure jakarta-tomcat common/lib  has a jdbc.jar file in it from postgres. (e.g. copy a jar file  found in /usr/share/pgsql/ )

5. RUN SERVER - run jakarta tomcat  "catalina.sh debug"
	      - start postgres , 
			- psql gnumed   -check user access
			- psql drugref  -check user access and perms (see note in 3)


6. DEPLOY - *Copy* the gnumes-test-war.war to the webapps directory of jakarta-tomcat, 




Newer Notes on setup (6/10/2004):

The dist ant build task was fixed to copy a war file specific META-INF/context.xml file , which uses
a relative file path in tomcat to ../webapps/gnumed-test-war  , so now the application should work
if the ant dist tasks work. Just drop the  dist/gnumed-test-war.war  package in the webapps directory of tomcat.
(which is supposed to be how it works).  However, all the stuff about setting up postgres, gnumed on postgres using
redo-max.sh,  getting the packages for java sdk 1.4+,  ant , tomcat 5+ and struts-1.2.4 still has to be done, and
modifying copy_libs.sh to point to the path's for tomcat and struts still needs to be done (and run), and postgres still
needs to be running.

If the old way is preferred, then the new tomcat application name is /gnumed-test-web . vs. /gnumed-test-war for the war drop-in.


Notes on CVS:
	I had some trouble getting the test-struts-3 directory.

cvs -z3 -d<username>@savannah.gnu.org/cvsroot/gnumed checkout gnumed/gnumed/test-area/sjtan/test-struts-3

This works, but only if run at the root of the local copy of the cvs gnumed tree, othewise
mv gnumed/gnumed/test-area/sjtan/test-struts-3 ../sjtan/test-struts-3 works , if in the
sjtan directory, then remove the gnumed/gnumed .. directory.
then add in the CVS/Entries file ( in test-area/sjtan/CVS ) D/test-struts-3/////




Notes on Install:

The following 4 links will be read by download.sh , and downloaded.

The following steps were tested:



A.Have a java sdk1.4.2  installed.

	http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/java-linux/JDK-1.4.2/i386/rc1/j2re-1.4.2-rc1-linux-i586-gcc2.95.bin

(Change the above url to ...gcc3.2.bin  if wanting the gcc3.2 version.)


B.Have ant installed.

From
	http://apache.planetmirror.com.au/dist/ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.6.2-bin.tar.bz2


From
http://apache.planetmirror.com.au/dist/ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.6.2-bin.tar.bz2


C.get a version of commons-lang
http://www.apache.org/dist/jakarta/commons/lang/binaries/commons-lang-2.0.tar.gz
( This jar file went missing , so need it directly; copy it into the WEB-INF/lib directory)


http://apache.planetmirror.com.au/dist/jakarta/tomcat-5/v5.0.28/bin/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28.tar.gz
( This jar file went missing , so need it directly; copy it into the WEB-INF/lib directory)

D. get tomcat from

	http://apache.planetmirror.com.au/dist/jakarta/tomcat-5/v5.0.28/bin/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28.tar.gz

tar -zxvf xxx.tar.gz  to unpack.

E. get struts from
http://apache.planetmirror.com.au/dist/struts/library/jakarta-struts-1.2.4-lib.zip
(this is the latest version)

F. must also have a gnumed distribution installed a postgres directory.
	The easiest thing is to ensure postgresql is installed , and then run the redo-max.sh script in gnumed/server/bootstrap
(easy if you know the postgres user's  password)


In order to compile, certain library files must be COPIED into  WEB-INF/lib/ of this directory
	Reason: these files need to be found by the build.xml  

	look at copy_libs.sh which gives an example location of the necessary libs, and copies them.
	* change the paths to the struts , tomcat, and commons-lang base directory if needed.





Because of need for struts taglib dynamic access to bean variables, 
ALSO COPY 
	
	{struts-basedir}/contrib/lib/ contents to the WEB-INF/lib  directory. Actually, only struts-el.jar and html-el.tld is needed. 


4.
In order to run, {tomcat-basedir}/commons/lib/  must have a valid postgres jar file  (e.g. common/lib/pg73jdbc2.jar ).
 On the Mandrake system I am using, these jar files are found in /usr/share/pgsql  and there are 3 there, but you only
need one (xxxjdb2.jar seems to work).

	Reason: the tomcat server manages pooled database connections using commons-pool , and requires the database driver for
postgres which is it must be able to find.  {tomcat-basdir}/shared/lib  and this application WEB-INF/lib directory don't work
as places to put the postgres jar file.


5.In order to run tomcat,   {tomcat-basedir}/conf/tomcat-users.xml   should have the lines 
  <role rolename="manager"/>
  <role rolename="admin"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="tomcat,manager"/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="admin"/>


before running tomcat. This creates the roles of admin and manager. The manager role is the most important.

6. the file META-INF/context.xml and META-INF/war-context.xmll has the right username and password to connect
to the postgres gnumed database locally.

eg. from context.xml

 <ResourceParams name="jdbc/gnumed">
    <parameter>
      <name>factory</name>
      <value>org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSourceFactory</value>
    </parameter>
    <parameter>
      <name>driverClassName</name>
      <value>org.postgresql.Driver</value>
    </parameter>
    <parameter>
      <name>url</name>
      <value>jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/gnumed</value>
    </parameter>
    <parameter>
      <name>username</name>
      <value>_test-doc</value>
    </parameter>
    <parameter>
      <name>password</name>
      <value>test-doc</value>
    </parameter>

e.g. change to _test-doc , and password 'test-doc' to local write-enabled users
if this will work on the gnumed install.

** Please change 
	** ./war-context.xml **  
as well if the postgres config parameters are changed, 
as this allows the war packed application to work when
dropped into ${your-tomcat-base-directory}/webapps. ( i.e. no manager config)
  

7. compile by changing to /WEB-INF/src where the build.xml file is , and typing 'ant'.

8a. (If not using war drop-in)  Set the right context path in the  META-INF/context.xml  configuration file.

In the 3rd line,

<Context crossContext="true" debug="5" docBase="/home/sjtan/projects/test-struts-3" path="/gnumed-test-web" reloadable="true" scope="session">

change /home/sjtan/projects/test-struts-3  to where this directory resides, 
e.g. /home/john/projects/gnumed/gnumed/test-area/sjtan/test-struts-3

hint: test that it is the path by selecting the docBase string, and then on the command line, do a 'ls' and paste the string.

8b. (if using war drop-in)  Copy dist/gnumed-test-war.war to the ./webapps directory of tomcat.


9. start tomcat, by going to {tomcat-basedir}/bin/   and typing 'catalina.sh debug' , followed by 'run' at the '>' prompt.

10. go to http://localhost:8080  to see if tomcat ran.

11 
a. if using war drop-in, then the manager config can be skipped.

b.(if not using war drop-in)
	i. go to http://localhost:8080/manager ; if step 5. works, then the user name 'tomcat', password 'tomcat' should give
the manager page.
	ii. Point tomcat to the context.xml file of step 6.

		In the box on the manager page which says: -

12. Point tomcat to the context.xml file of step 6.
In the box on the manager page which says: -
		Deploy directory or WAR file located on server
		    XML Configuration file URL: [                       ]

		e.g. put the URL as 
			file:/home/john/projects/gnumed/gnumed/test-area/sjtan/test-struts-3/META-INF/context.xml


		generally , it's 

		file:/${GNUMED_DIR}/gnumed/gnumed/test-area/sjtan/test-struts-3/META-INF/context.xml

		i.e whatever  is the URL file path to the file edited in step 8b. ( note the single slashed file:/ as a url base)

		When the deploy button is pressed, there should be an OK - gnumed-test-web deployed message, 

13. Using the demographics application:  e.g.  go to 
	
	http://localhost:8080/gnumed-test-war (if using war drop-in)
or
	http://localhost:8080/gnumed-test-web (if not using war drop-in)
							
14. click login.
	the user name  "admin" ,
	 password "password" 

 is the only login.
	From the login page, a new patient can be created or patient search is done. 
	Clicking patient names found will edit that patient. 
	"clinical" href will take to the clinical screen. 
		Here the current functionality is:

			(6/10/04) - add episodes , episode narrative items , episode vaccinations, episode allergies,
				episode vital signs ( height, and weight ;   it is ready for other vital signs, but the
				schema data for these are not in the gnumed schema scripts yet ).
				( correcting old entries not done yet)
				- show  printable summary and past notes page.

			- health Summary of previous encounters are on the right,
			the entry part is top left, and the previous past notes are in the bottom left.
