this bug occurs more on tomcat 5.0  than 5.5

- the 5.0 resource configuration is more verbose xml, using nested xml elements instead of attributes.

- the actual context.xml file used for gnumed-test-war will be in CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost.
Always check this one actually is configured properly ( e.g. no missing end of comments when switching
between a 5.0 and 5.5 configuration).
fix this one first, then copy to the webapps/{appname}/META-INF  and remember it isn't fixed in the war file.

- a posting says that the path to the driver e.g. postgresql.jar , needs to be in CATALINA_HOME/common/lib
and NOWHERE else. ( why ? ) . A possible explanation - the classpath of an application in WEB-INF/lib , isn't
available to the tomcat server, which uses common/lib, but classes can only be loaded by the classloader
from one path, so if the private path takes precedence, the tomcat server will not be able to access
it ( sort of makes sense).
