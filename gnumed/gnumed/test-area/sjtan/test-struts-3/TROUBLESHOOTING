-ant not found . - download ant binary package from apache and add as root, a soft link as /usr/bin/ant	
			e.g. if ant downloaded to /home/john/downloada/ant-1.5 then ln -s /home/john/downloads/ant-1.5/bin/ant /usr/bin/ant
			and  'export ANT_HOME=/home/john/downloads/ant-1.5'  shows up with env.

-no javac, java found - should load jdk1.5 


-running ant says no build file ; change dir to test-struts-3/WEB-INF/src
-running ant  comes up with 100 errors. ls test-struts-3/WEB-INF/lib  and see if any files. copy struts/lib/* to test-struts-3/WEB-INF/lib .
-running ant comes up with 20 errors.  copy tomcat/commons/lib/servlet-api.jar to test-struts-3/WEB-INF/lib .

-can't run tomcat. jdk present?

-can't get to http://localhost:8080 when tomcat is running: url is right?

-permission denied when click Manager in left hand menu. 
 Haven't set users-xml.xml with a role manager and manager in a user's roles? change it , and  Stop and Start tomcat to get rid of previous tomcat state. ?using the right user and password.



-pasting WEB-INF/context.xml  doesn't work ? 
	using the url prefix "file:"  before the full path to this file ? 
	ls the path correct? 'ls' the path used to see if it exists.
	Is the context.xml  docBase='path-to-test-struts-3' correct? 'ls' the docBase string to see if exists and leads
	to where the application home directory is.


If using the war file, make sure the webapps/gnumed-test-war/META-INF/context.xml
has the docPath="./gnumed-test-war"; if it doesn't change it,
then delete the conf/Catalina/localhost/gnumed-test-war.xml
which is cached copy of the previous context.xml, if it exists.

 
-SUDDENLY the web app doesn't work?
	-something may have been deleted?
	-e.g. tomcat/conf.../gnumed-test-web.xml is being used (the absolute filepath docPath)
and the WEB-INF/classes file directory is missing  because CVS was stuffed up because the CVS directory in classes was deleted,
and when it regenerates during an ant build, no CVS directory is there, so the easiest thing was to delete it before
a cvs commit.



URL should be
file:/${GNUMED_DIR}/gnumed/gnumed/test-area/sjtan/test-struts-3/META-INF/context.xml

where GNUMED_DIR is the basedir where CVS checkout was done.


-'deploy button' says already deployed. Undeploy, stop and start tomcat again. Try pasting context file again and depoloy.

-not finding the application, at http:/localhost:8080/test-struts-3 , try clicking the hypertexted test-struts-3 at the manager screen.
                                                                      try restart catalina.
 
- login 'admin' doesn't work ; is cookie password being used? use password 'password'

- search doesn't work. Comes up with missing org.postgresql.Driver ;  copy pg73jdbc2.jar  or whatever postgres jar file is supplied
to tomcat/commons/lib/  directory, and restart tomcat/catalina. 

- check <username > <password>  in META-INF/context.xml are set to correct user name and password for write access in your gnumed setup.

- search 'blocks' : ? deadlock somewhere. Get rid of old browser clients to same web page. stop catalina. restart postgres. restart catalina.
		? typed a small criteria  and too many records being retrieved?



DRUGREF access errors.

- When selecting find Drugs, error ' can't find drugRefCandidates in any scope ' occurs.
This is due probably to a permission denied to v_drugref1 for the particular user set up on the connection.
grant access to this user from the owner of the database.   


SEVERE:  ********** UNABLE TO SET 'DRUG REF ACCESS' ***************  of servlet context
org.apache.commons.dbcp.SQLNestedException: Cannot create PoolableConnectionFactory, cause:
A connection error has occurred: FATAL:  No pg_hba.conf entry for host 127.0.0.1, user _test-doc, database drugref

This is another error about drugref access, pg_hba.conf needs to be set.
On Mandrake, the postgresql default data directory is in /var/psql/data


ERROR:  Relation 'v_drugref1' already exists

INFO: got java.sql.SQLException: ERROR:  link_product_manufacturer: permission denied
 when SELECT FROMv_drugref1

This could be a table granularity access error. The view may be accessible but the user
is not allowed to reference the underlying tables.
	-got rid of the view , now a prepared select statement
	still need permission to read tables, so
	run set_perms_drugreg.sh after editing for users.
