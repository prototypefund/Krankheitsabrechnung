This is a release of the source of GNUMed based on a CVS snapshot on 20/2/04
GNUMed is in early development, it is not ready for clinical use.

This packaging is for Linux/Unix type systems only. It will not work on Windows.
Mac OS X: worth a try?

This package contains the client software only.

To install, run
	python install.py

in this directory

install.py takes several options
	MANIFEST=1    -- creates a MANIFEST file listing all the files installed
                         useful for packagers
	PREFIX=foo    -- the installation prefix. Default: /usr
	BINDIR=foo    -- location of the gnumed binary. Default: /usr/bin
	DOCDIR=foo    -- location of the documentation, Default: /usr/share/doc/gnumed

	remove        -- removes the previously installed files.

The installer also installs /etc/gnumed.conf if it doesn't already exist.

Once you have installed, typing "gnumed" at the prompt will start the client,
you will see a login screen. If you get that far, let us know on
gnumed-devel@gnu.org, and we'll give you the address of a server to connect to.
