.TH GM-BACKUP_DATABASE 8 "2009 January 8th" "GNUmed server database backup"

.SH NOTE

.I Deprecated in favour of gm-backup(8).

.SH NAME
.B gm-backup_database
- complete backup of GNUmed database

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gm-backup_database

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B gm-backup_database
script creates a backup of the database schema,
data, and roles which can be used to restore a GNUmed
database from scratch.

It is a really good idea to use it in a daily cron/anacron
job to ensure that GNUmed patient data are safe against data
loss.  The Debian GNU/Linux packaged version of the GNUmed
server installs such a cron job by default.

It is recommended to use
.B gm-backup
instead.
