></H3
><P
>		A Health Issue is a longer ranging medical condition associated with
		a patient. There may be several episodes related with one health
		issue and there must be at least one. At times a health issue will
		first be appreciated by considering underlying similarities between
		several medically related episodes. A health issue may have a finite
		duration if the underlying medical condition is eventually fully
		resolved. It may also span the entire life of the patient such as
		in chronic or genetic ailments. Start and end are not directly
		recorded but must be derived from the start of the earliest and
		the end of the most recent associated episode.

></H3
><P
>		A Clinical Episode denotes a period of time during which the patient
		was under care for one particular Health Issue (medical condition).
		Several episodes (eg. progression, bouts, etc.) may be associated
		with a particular health issue. There can be several encounters per
		episode, there must be at least one. The start and end of an episode
		isn't directly recorded but rather one can deduce that data from the
		associated clinical items of which there will usually be several
		(but at least one). Often, several providers will contribute to an
		episode of care (via several encounters and items). One would think
		that episodes can be deduced from clusters of closely related dates
		of clinical encounters. While this is true it cannot be used reliably
		in a programmatic way.

>5.6.2.3. Clinical Encounter</A
></H3
><P
>		A one-off contact between patient and health care system (or on behalf
		of the patient) is called a "Clinical Encounter". An encounter is often
		restricted to a given date but may span midnight and will thus refer to
		two dates. The date itself is not directly stored in the encounter
		table clin_encounter but must be determined from the commit timestamps
		of the clinical items belonging to it. The encounter table records the
		location, provider and subject of care as well as the type of encounter.
		It really is more of an administrative than a purely clinical concept.
		Note that it also does not fit hospital stays particularly well where
		it is harder to define clean boundaries between encounters. One
		encounter will often relate to more than one episode/health issue.

></H3
><P
>		In GNUmed a medically meaningful piece of information is called "Clinical
		Item". Such items are typically elements of the SOAP structure such as a
		diagnosis, a history item, an assessment, a plan, etc. Several tables,
		both specific and generic store such items. They all inherit from the
		table clin_root_item which records the Clinical Encounter and Clinical
		Episode this item belongs to. Virtue of inheriting from clin_root_item all
		Clinical Item tables also have a generic "narrative" field for comments
		and clinical narrative.

>&#13;		This concept of the Dutch Episode Model is not directly

		Clinical Items that belong to the same Clinical Encounter
		and the same Clinical Episode.

>5.6.3.1. Clinical narrative</A
></H3
><P
>		Due to the fact that clinical items are stored in several different
		specific and non-specific tables it is difficult to do a full-text
		search across the medical record of a patient. For this reason all
		clinical narrative is aggregated in the clin_root_item table. All
		tables providing clinical narrative are supposed to inherit from
		this table. If more than one field for free text is needed in a
		table links to entries in clin_note must be used additionally
		to the inherited clin_root_item.narrative field.
	    	</P
><P
>		The view v_patient_items provides an aggregation of clinical
		items per patient. From this one can derive the item ID and source
		table of individual items. It also provides the full text of the
		clinical narrative for all tables that inherit from clinical item.
		Only very few clinically relevant narrative strings are not stored
		in such tables, namely comments on clin_episode, clin_encounter
		and clin_health_issue rows.

		default language is English, other languages are handled via
		translations. In appropriate cases views may facilitate easier
		access to translated strings. Names of such views are to be
		prepended by "v_i18n_".
