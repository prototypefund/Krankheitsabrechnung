This directory contains wxGlade *.wxg XML files which are
used to generate boilerplate Python classes defining the
basic GUI layout.

The generated classes (in client/wxGladeWidgets/) are then
used as base classes to inherit from for actual GUI classes
in client/wxpython/.

If you want to change the look of a widget in GNUmed find
the corresponding *.wxg file and edit that using wxGlade.
Then regenerate the base class and put the file into
client/wxGladeWidgets/. Be careful to stick to the attribute
names (say, buttons) and EVENT method names to make GNUmed
transparently use your layout changes. Else you will have to
edit the code in the final widget somewhere in
client/wxpython/*.py to provide appropriately named methods
and access the right attributes.
