Acarodermatitis (Scabies)
Wikipedia, GFDL, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Acarodermatitis_Hand.jpg

Intensely itchy, generalised erythematous papules, 3-4mm in size.
The itch usually occurs first. Gnerally the face is not involved.

Burrows are tiny lines 0.5-1cm long, usually in the webs of fingers, 
flexor aspect of the wrist, armpits, elbows, areolae and gentials.

Diagnosis is by skin-scraping of a burrow for mite eggs or faeces.

Treatment is by 5% permethrin to the entire body except the face,
including asymptomatic family members,
this treatment may need to be repeated, plus torough washing of bedlinen.

If this fails, oral ivermectin can be used.
