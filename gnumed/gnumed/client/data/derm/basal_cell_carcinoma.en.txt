Wikipedia, GFDL, http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Basaliom1.jpg

A single erthyematous erosive lesion, with a pearly rim, not itchy, usually
in sun-exposed areas.

A tumour which almost never metastasizes, but can erode into local tissue.
Excision is diagnostic and therapeutic, only 2-3mm of margin is sufficient. 
Topical therapy with 5-FU is also described.
