Contact dermatitis
Wikipedia, GFDL, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Dermatitis.jpg

A localised area of continuous erythema, itchy, sometimes with cracks or small
blisters.

The key is to indentify the allergene, this isnot always possible.
Usually a new soap or shampoo, base metals as part of clothing can 
also be a cause.

The treatment is by mild topical steroids such as hydrocortisone 1%.
