This directory stores connectors specific to this client.

Connectors are intermediate programs that 3rd party legacy
applications can use to control a GNUmed instance.

The one provided connector can, for example, be used by any
practice management application in Germany that knows how to
output GDT or BDT files. The connector attaches to GNUmed
via XML-RPC, tells it to load an external patient (which
loads the patient from the BDT/GDT file if properly
configured), locks into that patient and raises a particular
plugin (gmShowMedDocs in this case). If you want your
connector to do something different you can derive a class
from the cBaseConnector class and override the run_script()
method.

The calls you can use on the controlled GNUmed instance are
the methods provided by client/wxpython/gmMacro.py.
