"""
This module is used to create a slideshow where each slide shows information
about one Timeline event.

When used, one html page is generated for each event in the selected timeline
and stored on the disk selected by the user.
The default browser on the host is opened with the html page of the first
event of the timeline. Thereafter the user can scroll through all event
html pages by clicking on forward and backward links.
