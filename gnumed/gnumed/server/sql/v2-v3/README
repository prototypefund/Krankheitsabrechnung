This directory contains database change scripts for a v2-v3
database conversion.

All changes in the subdirectory dynamic/ apply to dynamic
DDL elements and can therefore be re-run at any time without
modifying the actual data.

Dynamic DDL elements include:

- views
- functions
- indices
- comments
- rules

Scripts in the subdirectory static/ apply changes which can
only be run once while converting from v2 to v3.

They include

- schema changes
- table alterations
- column changes



Things that may or may not be re-run safely include:

- constraints (if they require data changes)
- triggers (if they act like constraints)
