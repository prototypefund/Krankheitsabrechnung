The files and scripts in the bootstrap/ directory are intended for
bootstrapping a new or upgrading an existing GNUmed database.

The main bootstrapper is bootstrap_gm_db_system.py. It does
all the heavy lifting including setting up the database,
making sure users and procedural languages are set up and
importing the schema definition files.

The bootstrap-latest.sh shell script creates the latest version
of the GNUmed database from scratch. It DROPS any EXISTING
gnumed_v* DATABASES along the way.

The upgrade-db.sh script upgrades an existing GNUmed database.
The original database WILL NOT BE CHANGED in any way. This allows
for SAFE UPGRADES from one database version to the next. The
upgrade procedure can be repeated.

The fixup-db.sh script applies fixes to an existing GNUmed
database. It can be run any number of times. It always
applies all accumulated fixes for a given database version.

Bootstrapping is a rather complicated affair. Here are some
prerequisites that need to be matched:

1) The scripts are best run as root.

2) You need to have the procedural language pl/pgsql
   available (Installed in the Operating System,
   that is. GNUmed will install it into the
   database if needed).

3) After bootstrapping you need to add the following
   lines to your pg_hba.conf file to allow GNUmed
   users to connect:

# for local connections from the same machine
local	samerole	+gm-logins							md5

# for remote connections from other machines
host	samerole	+gm-logins		<IP/NETMASK>		md5



Enjoy and please do report bugs !
