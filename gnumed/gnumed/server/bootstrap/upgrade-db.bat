REM if you need to adjust the database name to something
REM other than what the config file has you can use the
REM following environment variable:
REM SET GM_CORE_DB=gnumed_v%NEXT_VER%

REM if you need to adjust the port you want to use to
REM connect to PostgreSQL you can use the environment
REM variable below (this may be necessary if your PostgreSQL
REM server is running on a port different from the default 5432)
REM SET GM_DB_PORT=5433
